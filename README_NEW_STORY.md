## 📝 Story Overview

The world ended not with a bang, but with a whisper. A whisper that grew into a scream.

You wake to Alex from 4B pounding on your door. He's bitten. Infected. Desperate. The choice you make here - to save him or abandon him - sets everything in motion.

Every decision matters. Every choice ripples forward. Who will you become when the world falls apart?
