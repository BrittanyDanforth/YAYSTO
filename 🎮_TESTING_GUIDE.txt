If you can't see the game, try these test files:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 📂 TEST FILES CREATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. simple_test.html
   - Shows what's loading
   - Displays diagnostic information
   - Shows if elements are being created

2. minimal_game.html
   - Bare minimum version
   - Just the game, nothing else
   - Easier to see what's happening

3. debug_test.html
   - Technical diagnostics
   - Shows scene count, data loading
   - Good for checking if JS is working

4. mystory.html
   - Full game with all styling
   - This is the one you want to use once it's working


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 1: Try minimal_game.html first
  → Open minimal_game.html in your browser
  → You should see "CONSEQUENCE: THE BLOOM" as title
  → Below that, the story should appear
  → 4 choice buttons should be visible

STEP 2: Check browser console
  → Press F12 to open developer tools
  → Click "Console" tab
  → Look for errors (red text)
  → You should see: "🎮 Minimal game starting..."
  → And: "✓ Game created successfully"

STEP 3: If you see errors:
  → Look for "failed to load" messages
  → Check if NEW_MYSTORY_COMPLETE.js is loading
  → Make sure all 3 files are in same folder:
    - minimal_game.html (or mystory.html)
    - NEW_MYSTORY_COMPLETE.js
    - MYSTORY.CSS

STEP 4: Check file paths
  → Right-click page, "View Page Source"
  → Look for: <script src="NEW_MYSTORY_COMPLETE.js">
  → Click that link - should show JavaScript code
  → If it says "404 Not Found", file is not in right place


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 ✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE

3. Story Text:
   "You wake to the sound of pounding on your apartment door.
    Frantic, desperate pounding...
    
    'PLEASE! OH GOD PLEASE OPEN UP!'
    
    It's Alex from 4B..."

4. Four Choice Buttons:
   □ Open the door and pull him inside [compassionate]
   □ Ask what happened through the door [cautious]
   □ Ignore him and check outside [survivalist]
   □ Stay completely silent [ruthless]
